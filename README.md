# Data-Structure-Algorithms-in-Python
This repository will have many algorithm implementation in python , simulation and some python templates.

# Rules:

1) Anyone can provide any algorithm or data structure implementation.
If you want to contribute,firstly you have to fork the repository.Work on that repository then send pull request.Please give a reference that which problem you solved ,which algorithm you implemented or what modifications you have done.

2) If you want a implementation or any kind help or any questions then you can write that in the issue section.

3) You can give suggestion in issue section to make the repository better.

4) Don't add any solution of Problems in the repository only algorithm/data sructure implementation will be accepted.
You can provide program templates.Such as-  Removing duplicates from a list or Counting frequency of numbers in list. 
Any modified template of algorithms will also be allowed. Such as - Finding Shortest Path using BFS/DFS , Find the node that is unreachable from the source using Dijkstra/BFS/DFS etc . So this kind of implementation will be allowed.
